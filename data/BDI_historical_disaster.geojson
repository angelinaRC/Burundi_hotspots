This was one of the many floods which have affected the country since January 2018. Like many others, this area is prone to periodic flooding and has a population comprising of farmers, livestock and small traders. A joint assessment conducted on 9 May by Burundi Red Cross Society, the government of Burundi, OCHA, WFP, UNICEF, IOM, NRC, Millions for One and PACT in 6 sites in Gatumba indicated that flooding in Gatumba was caused by overflow of two rivers, Rusizi 1 and 2 which are tributaries of Lake Tanganyika crossing Gatumba area from Kivu.\nThe flooding had severe consequences with 12,956 people (2,143 men, 2,258 women and 8,555 children) and 2,133 houses affected in 9 locations. Damage to infrastructure, including bridges and roads is also reported, hampering access to the affected population. With the assessed needs, urgent support is required for 12,956 people in Gatumba in the following sectors; Shelter, WASH, livelihoods and basic needs, health and protection, gender and inclusion (PGI). It should be noted that climate change is expected to increase the frequency and impact of hydro-meteorological hazards. ", "Shelter": "589 houses partially damaged and 1,041 houses were affected. Worst affected areas are Gaharawe, Mushasha I and II where most houses are built with Adobe \/ poles and earth, with sheet metal covers.\nFor homes that were flooded, although the water is receding, many of them are at risk of collapse because their foundations (fragile) suffered extensive damage.\nOver 95% of displaced families have taken shelter in host families.\nIn addition, families whose houses collapsed have lost most of their household items including sleeping mats, personal effects, blankets, mosquito nets, kitchen utensils, school supplies for children, etc.", "FSL": "The displaced population is experiencing food shortages due to loss of livelihood, low purchasing power and disruption of markets. Most of the farmlands with matured crops have been washed away, small animals like rabbits and chicken as well have been swept away by the flooding water.\nFarming activities on the other hand have also been disrupted and this translates to low income across board. Famers work in their farms once a week as compared to before flooding season where they worked 5 times a week.\nAlthough markets are physically accessible, economic access has been affected as prices of key commodities have increased rapidly due to floods.\nIn terms of food access, displaced families rely on one meal a day for both adults and children. In normal situations families feed twice a day.", "WaSH": "Water fountains are the main sources of water serving the entire population in Gatumba region. In all the areas visited, these fountains continue to supply water to the affected population. Most households have limited storage capacity as they lost their jerrycans in the floods.\nRegarding the impact of the floods on sanitation, the assessed population reported that latrines have collapsed. As a result, water sources and soils are contaminated in the immediate grounds around houses, schools and public facilities. Provision of san plats for temporary latrines construction and hygiene promotion are critical to maintain healthy standards and reduce risks or possible water borne outbreaks particularly in Gaharawe where the risk of epidemic is high.\nAdolescent school going girls said during the assessment that they do not attend school during menstruation because they do not have menstruation management means, women on the other hand reported using old clothes of their children.\nFrom the areas visited, handwashing devices were missing in the areas visited by the assessment team.

In response to this specific disaster, Burundi Red Cross Society deployed emergency response teams comprising of 20 volunteers and 6 staff from the affected areas to evacuate floods affected population and administer first aid to people in need immediately after the flooding occurred. The team conducted a joint assessment with partners on 9th May 2018. BRCS volunteers\ncarried out disinfection of water sources and displacement sites where latrines had been destroyed to prevent a Cholera outbreak.

Around 8,000 families have been affected and 2,000 displaced by flooding in lakeside communities including Bugarama, Kanyenkoko, Muhuta, Nyanza-Lac, Gatumba, Rukaramu, Kibenga, Gisyo and Kabondo. Tourist places and infrastructures have also been badly affected, water and sanitation infrastructures impacted. The roads to Gisyo and Kibenga are no longer passable. Hundreds of houses are flooded, and currently uninhabitable. At least one landslide has been reported by the Government in Bujumbura Province that has destroyed at least 40 houses. \n\nSince then, teams from the Red Cross in Burundi said they have counted around 6,400 homeless households in Gatumba and Rukaramu. \n\nFlooding from the lake has also affected areas in southern Burundi. According to local media, buildings and infrastructure have been damaged by flooding from the overflowing lake in areas of Nyanza Lac in Makamba Province. The situation is likely to worsen as the number of affected people continues to grow along with the lake’s water level which began to rise gradually over a year ago and reached a tipping point for many coastal villages over the last week. According to the Geographic Institute of Burundi, the cause of Lake Tanganyika rising is two-fold; unseasonal heavy rainfall across the sub-region in countries bordering the Lake (such as Rwanda, the United Republic of Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and the Lukuga river that is overflowing - a tributary of the Lualaba River in the DRC that is normally an outlet for the Lake. According to meteorological projections, the rains are expected to continue until mid-May. Analysts say that the cause of the increase of water levels is coupled with the climate change.                                                                                                                                                                            \n\nUrgently respond is needed to address the most basic needs of the most vulnerable people – such as safe shelter, clean water and protection.This situation occurs during the negative socio-economic effects of COVID-19 and the increase in cases of community transmission. The floods increase the risks of diseases with potential epidemic, including malaria and cholera.\n\nUPDATE: Floods triggered by the rising level of Lake Tanganyika, due to heavy rain since the start of the rainy season in March, continue to affect the coastal area of western Burundi, resulting in displacements and widespread damage. The worst affected are Bujumbura, Bujumbura Mairie, Makamba, and Rumonge Provinces, located in the northern coastal area of the Lake.\n\nUN OCHA reports, as of 25 May, more than 1,660 displaced households, 2,217 affected households and around 1,600 damaged houses across the Rumonge Province. The port of Rumonge Town were also reported affected. In addition, a number of destroyed roads were reported across the Makamba Province.\n", "Shelter": "~6,400 households have become homeless, since homes are flooded. Some families remain in partly submerged homes. Note that the number of displaced households continues to increase day by day following the continued rise of the waters of Lake Tanganyika. Households directly affected by the floods have lost much of their property as household items were washed away by floodwater.", "FSL": "Farmers and fishers have lost their food stocks for the year and essential field crops are now destroyed. Flooding has destroyed more than 400 hectares of crops that were ready for harvest.   In terms of food security and livelihoods, Rumonge, the majority of the population are farmers and fishermen. The floods have also affected agricultural fields, destroying crops at a time when fishing activity is no longer profitable due to a lack of fish, as evidenced by empty drying sheds and the closure of borders, which has limited small traders. Now, there is an impact on livelihoods (total or partial loss) especially on agricultural labour (due to flooding) and small- scale trade (closure of lake borders) in a context of COVID-19.  the small amount of food stock that the populations could have has been damaged by the flood waves", "WaSH": "Need for WaSH facilities. The access to safe water in the urban neighbourhoods of Rumonge is a major problem because households still use untreated, unsanitary water from Lake Tanganyika and the risk of contamination is increased by faecal waste from flooded latrines that has mixed with water from Lake Tanganyika. Rumonge is one of the provinces located in the cholera belt and the risk of waterborne diseases and cholera outbreak is very high.\nIn flood-affected neighbourhoods, most of the drinking water points have been damaged and people are sourcing from unsafe water sources from Lake Tanganyika and other rivers. Similarly, all latrines in the affected areas have been damaged and are not currently usable. People are forced to defecate in the wild, exposing them to diseases related to water and hygiene. There is a big need in term of hygiene promotion, latrines and household water treatment. \n", "Health and Nutrition": "A lack of hygiene and sanitation could expose populations to diseases with potential epidemics. At the level of the CEMINA accommodation room, the 34 households sleep almost in the open and are exposed to the risks of cold snap and developing acute respiratory infections, especially for children and the elderly. The displacement of families could be one of the factors of contamination and exposure to COVID- 19. Large families hosted by neighbours cannot respect the barrier measures and the lack of protection kits. To this must be added the threat of cholera in the region and the installation of female anopheles in stagnant water which could cause widespread malaria in the region. The lack of health education and poor awareness of the dangers of contaminated water exposes these communities to a higher level of vulnerability, as they continue to live in flooded areas. While necessary, the COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented by humanitarian organizations to protect beneficiaries and staff could impede humanitarian assistance.", "Education": "Only one school was severely affected by suspending classes. The pupils were temporarily installed at the Groupe Scolaire Congolais school in Rumonge. School children in the affected areas noticed that their school materials were damaged by the floods at the start of the third term. These schoolchildren are already supported but not in full. (IFRC) \/ Nearly 10,000 children in Bujumbura Rural Province have been forced to stop school although their third semester was due to begin. (OCHA)", "Infrastructure": "Infrastructure and buildings have been damaged. Tourist places and infrastructures have also been badly affected, water and sanitation infrastructures impacted. The roads to Gisyo and Kibenga are no longer passable", "Protection": "Protection aspects remain problematic in the areas hosting the displaced. For the 32 displaced persons placed in an evacuation centre, it was observed that the families consist of children (boys and girls). A large number of children need protection against the risks of exploitation, including through work in a context of lack of alternatives, and parental awareness so that children return to school. In this group, there is an immediate need for triage and assistance for people with specific needs: in particular people with chronic illnesses as well as women, pregnant and lactating women and girls of childbearing age who urgently need dignity kits and person with disability. Sensitization of displaced households and host households in the fight against GBV is an urgent need.", "Support": "Some land in Maramvya has been made available to house some of those displaced. The Burundi Red Cross has erected emergency shelters there for 467 households and will carry out site development work such as the construction of latrines. The government of Burundi through civil protection in collaboration with UNICEF will supply the site with drinking water.

In Kirundo province, nearly one season out of three has been underperforming since the early 2000s, and households find themselves in a vicious circle of loss and rebuilding of livestock and harvest for the lean season. Due to frequent destruction of crops for the past 20 years, households have had to plant new seeds every two years. \nIn 2021, households in eight zones of Busoni, Bugabira and Kirundo communes have lost seeds and crops because of the water deficit. The water deficit in some localities of Kirundo province, coupled with excessive rainfall in others, has affected some 20 per cent of households in the Northern Depression – or Bugesera – livelihood zone, representing 36,372 households in the communes of Busoni, Bugabira, Kirundo and Ntega, according to the estimates of the multisectoral assessment mission that took place from 21 to 23 January 2021. This new assessment identified 19,500 households in urgent need of seed and food assistance. As the shocks have occurred at the crucial flowering and ripening phase of the season’s crops, the damage to the 2021A season’s crops is significant, especially for cereals and pulses in the most affected areas. Elsewhere in the province, production is considered normal. With regards to nutrition, the preliminary results of the SMART survey of September 2020 concluded that the nutrition situation in Kirundo is precarious with a Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rate of 7 per cent, up from 4 per cent in 2019. Since the beginning of the situation in December 2020, the following has been reported:\n•\tLoss of pulse and cereal crops from the 2021A season with corn and sorghum stalks in fields used only as fodder for livestock;\n•\tDozens of households have left the province for other provinces in search of livelihood opportunities (for example, displacement to Cankuzo province);\n•\tCases of school dropouts, particularly in primary schools where the school feeding program has been suspended by the World Food Program (WFP) due to lack of funding (for example, according to monitoring reports by the provincial education inspectorate, one school in Cewe reports that a quarter of the school population or 200 students out of 800 have dropped out). WFP plans to resume the program in 30 targeted schools in the near future;\n•\tReports of increasing cases of malnutrition, including severe malnutrition and oedema, according to Concern World Wide (CWW). The peak of cases is expected during the lean season between March and May 2021;\n•\tIncreasing cases of begging and numbers of street children;\n•\tReports of disruption of Income Generating Activities (IGAs) and Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs), due to migration (for example, a CWW-supported pig farm whose members have informed the organization that they are unable to continue managing the farm while they go find food for their families; case of CARE GROUP volunteers affected by current displacements, etc.);\n•\tLimited dry food stocks;\n•\tMarket availability is improving, particularly for beans with the advent of the 2021 season crops in the unaffected hills;\n•\tRegarding crop prospects, while the affected hills expect no cereal and pulse crops for the 2021A season, crop prospects are good for the other unaffected localities, despite the risk of overlap with the 2021B season, particularly for sorghum.\nThe needs are compounded by aggravating factors, particularly those related to the significant movement of returnees from Mahama camp in Rwanda since August 2020 (nearly 70 per cent of Burundian refugees in Mahama camp are from Kirundo province), the reduced coverage of the school feeding program (37 schools compared to 62 previously), the impact of Covid-19, painted grasshoppers (Zonocerus variegatus) and swine diseases. \n\n\n\n", "Shelter": null, "FSL": "Dozens of households have migrated in search for other livelihood oppertunities.
